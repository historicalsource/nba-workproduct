ERROR: out of range dest frame on ANI_INTTOSEQ!
Offender is in interpolating from C_BCK4_L to D_RUN2_L
seq has 37 frames, trying for frame 58, original frame argument is -106.






JBJ		- when you score spch gets cutoff too often by atlanta up by 1 type speech calls
JBJ		- reduce taunt spch frequency
		- maybe always have ball stick to swatter when a real goaltend is called - because drone has to go chase
			down the swatted ball so the team can inbound - wastes time
		- drone caught ball right under rim, began/completed a lean out jumper in wrong direction - perhaps
			he was just past cener point, began seq that moved him over a bit, and rotate code decided to
			rotate back the other way.
		- 4/7/99 STILL! has problem of human running up to ball on the floor, doing pick-up seq, and not picking it up!!! 
		- Rob, guy was on grnd in a falldown/flail near the free throw line, and he did a backboard ally!  stop flailing guys
			from doing this
		- guy dunks, is starting a rim hang, then morphs into a land on butt flail (no one touched him), that tries to stay
			attached to the rim!  After getup finishes, the guy is standing in air and drifts down
		- guy running in place in middle of court - flags showed that he was currently a dunker
		- guy running against wall backwards, after sliding down court at wrong angles like we used to have!
		- put out fire in a hurry spch call plays wen other team is not on fire!
		- drone don't seem to respond to pass butn when nearing completion of a dunk
		- human can't tell drone to layup out of a drone dunk
		- tmsel snd gets cutoff even when only one guy is bought into game
		- drones still don't recognize when their tmate goes up for an allyoop - even when other tm is on tm fire!
			I saw a drone go up, and his tmate just stood alone, dribbling.
JBJ		- free throw shooter glitches badly when his dribble seq runs out and he goes to holding ball
JBJ		- 4/8/99 if you let meter time out, usually ball is in middle, and free throw is made!
		- put some of the regular stance seqs into pre tip - maybe just for last guy on left, since he isn't
			on scrn very long - fist pump, arm shake off pain, etc.
JBJ		- tipoff seq for top left guy, doing wild stretching of legs plays too fast - maybe add it to pre tip also!
		- find some god way to speed up jump ball
		- force tournament mode on last 5 drone tms - cheap infinite turbo abuse, etc.
		- shaq cuts off tmate spch call at pre tip - same for olujuwan?
		- make sure game says thank you after all 29 tms beaten
MCG		- do message at game over that say 2 pts awarded for create player - get cool snd from createp.bnk that snds like
			points awarded - for use by Guido at end of game pts awarded message (#'s 67,66,68)
		- search all of the FIX!!! / !!!FIX  comments
		- make team jersey in CAP gray - not black - 3 of them
BD		- BILL D. - allow backdoor setting of amode snds off/on
		- add audits displaying frequency of crash bugs
		- do pup tournament mode - check all places where it is needed - many no doubt
		- Go thru teamdata table and look at the various stats
		- have crowd in an animation at EOQ when camera pans on frozen action
		- vs page crash - Mike needs to timeout something?
		- add crowd snd at eoq!
		- add end game period by period score page
		- add percentaging to free throws
		- add other powerups
		- add fire to mug shot at half time
		- limit create a player hotspot - don't allow at halfcourt
		- 5/8/99 still have a blue flame problem on ball as it is dunked thru hoop...
		- music volume powerup
		- fix snds/grunts - too weak - only use loud/crisp ones
		- maybe add crowd to outdoor courts - they are weak right now...
		- show who scored flair effect
		- rebnd went thru guy via cylinders - happens when a shot is blocked
		- go thru all dunks
		- need tm fire message
		- add block attribute to something
		- rim hangers get cylindered off rim when another guy tries to hang on rim
		- amode crashed loading gameplay
		- bozo boxes
		- horse snds
		- 3 successfull allyoops per drone tmate per period
		- don't turbo if human isn't!
		- no nasty at eoq if ahead?
		- get some turbo refill on a turnover
		- show adjusted % for shots
		- guys jump up into tall rebnd when ball is at head height
		- add swats off of rim - not always rebnd snag
		- end game winner messages
		- overtime message
		- maybe get rid of ugly midair rotating towards ball as it sail past - just happens on blocks currently???
		- k_pmp2dunk goes thru ground
		- make fades/lean ins easier to trigger
ROB	- the offscrn code doesn't work right.  Only speed up def guy when he is off scrn in x, and only
			when he is coming back toward screen.  Right now, he speeds up on jump shots, and he speeds up when
			he is just going up and down
		- need more desperation shots that elevates and allows passing out of it
		- choreograph speech at jump ball/anncr/crowd/whistle, etc.
		- do better ref seqs.
		- get more variety on put backs - they get the biggest reaction from new people
		- guy went up for a layup, I was to his side, but when I jumped up to block, I floated back towards free throw line
			lets look at blocking drifts, and maybe drift along with shooter
		- coaching tip header is still the large font - match to other hdr bars
		- layups happen from behind hoop - they start from behind hoop also
		- add shoe squeaks/claps when guys are in pre tip warmup
		- in human vs human game, they should guard each other regardless of which joystick they use
		- target forward change problem - on shots/dunks/layups/etc.
		- put in drone backpedals for inbound
		- 2nd juke mv may be too strong
		- knockdwn that happens when you steal/push a juker should only happen when jukers dribble rating is high
		- ball was blocked, other guy was up in air doing a swat (2 handed swat down), and when he hit ball, the ball just
			attached to him!  It needs to morph into rebnd grab, from whatever block/swat it is in
		- put in cool inbound music snds
		- Mike needs to update to newest Glide code!
		- possibly add tm distinction type art to jumbotron - art is done
		- lens flare on mugs not just a flash when selected
		- have good passers do the cooler passes
		- add regular pass trails to on fire shot
		- add Isiah speech
		- line up hi score pages - maybe only show 9 values - line up all #'s hz
		- at start movie, the start butn is usually ignored - allow it
		- running down court, guys get stuck running against somebody - drone change, or cylinder slip off?
		- running pass stayed in one place
		- put in john root/japple dances on buyin scrn
		- use powerup snd that is hanging around from hangtime also
		- two handed ugly swat needs to switch to a snag if he is going to hold on to the ball
		- sometimes have ball swatted off of rim or try to rebound it but just deflect it around
		- put in cool crowd snds
		- put in lens flares
		- drones pass too much when down low in the paint and guys are up in their face!  Just let them shoot and get blocked
		- dbl tap turbo doesn't work on cabinet in hallway!  what the ? (only on player 1)
		- have drones do juke and head for 3 pt rng when under rim
		- don't allow drones to go behind hoop - ends up with ugly shots/etc.
		- add different swats/blocks art, then check to see what seq your tmate is using, and use something different!
		- in air pass towards a guy near the wall/corner caused recvr to run in place waiting for catch
			but he then misses catch
		- running in place pass still can happen
		- disallow airball of on fire shot - don't allow loser to airball
		- better crowd timing
		- fix glitch in crowd animation - they sit dwon in middle of animation
		- more airballs on full court (any 2%) shots
		- stats pages need much work
		- flash individual stat leader one at a time
		- glow the leaders disc under score
		- glow player leader
		- on initials entry, center cursor, fix the way it wraps, and when the stats pages
			appear, center the text in the box
		- make vs. page use icons only
		- add particles to on fire dunker?
		- check into turning on ghost code again
		- backdoor code
		- jukes can head right into sideline - ugly
		- at halftime, do stats zero out if you swap players?  my endgame stats don't nearly add up to what the score is
		- add dive for loose balls - drones only?  (only when a dive won't slam them into invisible wall and look bad)
		- award a free half to winner of 2 player game - option
		- shot clock appeared at botm of scrn thru eoq
		- when 4 create a players appear at halftime subs, the snds play/glitch loudly when they are auto repicked
		- fix hands on rim from dunk - plyrseq.c
		- the speedy getups don't seem to work - lets fix them - singlt tap getups, etc.
		- delay butn reading as you enter halftime substitutions page - accidental picking is happening
		- add other hook shots into game
		- just bumping into a guy, who is going up into jump shot causes ball to break loose - and shooter is flailed

NEW ART:

		- fix nbc court
		- two handed dunk where hands never touch ball - too wide - at least make it one handed!
		- can see thru olajuwon's mouth
TB	- make vs. page use icons only - what icons?
		- brian grant of portland has a headband and dreadlocks now



**********************************************************************************************************************

Stuff for Rob

 		- still!! 3/12/99 crowd ends with a big glitch
    	- put in stumble dribble
    	- when retreiving ball prior to inbound, and running OB, just carry ball in hand - don't dribble (sometimes)
		- put in walk ani rules
	 	- do more quick off the backboard dunks
		- Rules for hook shots suck - make them a higher shot % - turbo is a higher arc, and

    	- Retro mode with big hair etc.
    	- New hand model that has just index finger up in air - calling play seq, pointing seqs.

		- Dan, talk to me about spline slow down/speed up stuff
		- camera on fire shot explosion - close pan around rim
		- don't display please wait message at top of screen - only when start button has been hit
		- show leader up close dribbling on court
		- flag shot blocks for playing back in instant replay - don't always have to show te score after a score
		- put cool spline jump ball camera into amode - whips around players at center court
		- inbnd camera glitch
		- inbnd camera should pull backa bit
		- saw pre-tip camera that was much tighter on the guys - it was cool - don't know how it happened
		- show the jumbo tron in some camera path
		- CPU icons mess up from time to time when camera is moving around - especially other camera angles
		- when retreiving ball after shotclock violation - zoom in on face of that guy as he goes gets it
		- for end of period, camera will focus on rim when ball is in air - choose a shot with multiple rim hits!
		- smooth camera
		- Put number on chest when a pass is sent his way
		- LO RES to ship day one
		- fix up names/insert coins to control messages above turbo bars
		- Trivia contest

**********************************************************************************************************************

		- advertise time release/rules

**********************************************************************************************************************

Stuff for Jeff

		- Dive for loose balls like Blitz - rare to have a loose ball, but it would be cool - Rob was gonna look at it - check with him
		- LO RES to ship day one

**********************************************************************************************************************

Stuff for Mark T. / General ideas we should think about implementing

		- put in bozo boxes
		- check possession change rules for shot clock
		- add sparkles on up front screens
		- put in cpu assistance stuff
		- add sal to high scores
		- shot clock doesn't appear when less than 30 seconds left in qrtr, but still active!

**********************************************************************************************************************

Stuff for Mike & Ed & Bill (Diagnostics)

		- BILL D. - allow backdoor setting of amode snds off/on

**********************************************************************************************************************

Stuff for Shawn Liptak - drone stuff

		- pay attention to fire/tm fire/hotspots - get opponent off of these modes also!
		- drone run halfway to ball (ball up hi), stop, then run again
			very important now that you can gt/swat ball away - as guy goes to retrieve ball, he glitches along as
			he gets close - see it all the time
		- drones run dwn court in front of offense guy without ball, hop skip, stop, hop skip, stop
		- too many passes when well covered in the paint - they keep passing - just let a block happen
		- allow passing out of flail
		- big explosion on rim/bboard when we want to break backboard
		- shawn, have drones do leaning in dribble seq.
		- have drones run backwards downcourt
		- drones fade away when they are near OB
		- sometimes all 4 drones can't reach ball in corner - they wait forever
		- can't tell my drone to layup out of dunks!  Is his butn already down?


**********************************************************************************************************************

Powerup ideas

		- no crowd
		- shirts off
		- Powerup a different camera perspective
		- Powerup mode where there is no crowd - just bleachers
		- Powerup to turn off auto rebounding
		- put in run n gun camera as powerup - camera mode needs some work
		- Powerup to have center adverts scrolling fast/always - easy to do "next_scroll_wait"
		- more snow
		- no freethrows
		- trees or ocean
		- bigger snow flakes
		- baby players
		- jersey options
		- powerup to jump straight up, no drift
